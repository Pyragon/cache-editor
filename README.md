# Cryo Cache Editor

A browser-based editor for RuneScape 2 (revision 727) game cache files, built with Vite + React + TypeScript. Uses the [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API) to read and write cache files directly from disk — no server required.

## Usage

1. Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`
2. Open the app in your browser and click **Open Cache**
3. Select your unpacked cache folder (or a folder containing an `unpacked/` subfolder)
4. Browse cache entries in the sidebar and select items to view or edit

## Cache Entries

Ordered to match [`IndexType.java`](https://github.com/Pyragon/cryogen/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryo/cache/IndexType.java) in the cryogen repo — the numbers are that enum's index ids. A few IndexType members share one physical folder (e.g. `animations/` holds `animation_frame_sets`, `animation_frame_bases`, and `animations` as separate subpaths) and are listed as separate rows here. Entries marked **Not implemented upstream** have no `dumpFiles()` support in cryogen's own unpacker, so no folder for them will ever appear in a cache dump.

Sidebar colours: **green** = feature-complete editor (user-reviewed), white = dedicated viewer/editor in progress, **amber** = dumped but only the raw-JSON fallback so far, **red** = not present in the dump (disabled).

Status legend: **✅ Done** = complete & reviewed (green) · **Editor** = full editable editor built, pending review (some await a re-dump — see below) · **Viewer** = read-only or partial viewer · **Not started** = raw-JSON fallback only · **Not implemented upstream** = no cryogen `dumpFiles()`, never appears in a dump.

Entries whose cryogen dumper was field-renamed against darkan-bot-refactor this pass need a **re-dump** before their editor shows correct data: `items`, `objects`, `npcs`, and config `hitsplats`.

### Config sub-archives

Sub-archives of `IndexType.CONFIG(2)`, mirroring [`FileType.java`](https://github.com/Pyragon/cryogen/blob/master/src/main/java/com/cryo/cache/FileType.java) (unnamed `SCT_#` placeholders excluded). Shown in-app as a collapsible dropdown under the **Config** sidebar entry. Entries marked *Not dumped* have no folder in the current cache dump.

Ordered to match `FileType.java` (its numeric ids in parentheses). Many members aren't present in the current dump — marked *Not dumped*.

| # | Entry | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `underlays` | Not dumped | |
| 3 | `identikits` | Not started | Folder-per-id `.lnk` dump format — needs flattening + re-dump like cursors |
| 4 | `overlays` | Not dumped | |
| 5 | `inventories` | ✅ **Done** | Slot length + default-stock pairs with item-icon previews |
| 6 | `objects` | Not dumped | Config sub-archive, distinct from the top-level `objects` index |
| 8 | `enums` | Not dumped | Config sub-archive, distinct from the top-level `enums` index |
| 9 | `npcs` | Not dumped | Config sub-archive, distinct from the top-level `npcs` index |
| 10 | `items` | Not dumped | Config sub-archive, distinct from the top-level `items` index |
| 11 | `params` | ✅ **Done** | Type-char dropdown, default int, auto-disable |

| 15 | `varc_string` | Not dumped | |
| 16 | `vars` | ✅ **Done** | Param-type dropdown + client code (verified against darkan `VarpType`: only opcodes 1/5 exist, so the sparse data is correct) |
| 19 | `varc` | Not dumped | |
| 26 | `structs` | ✅ **Done** | Param key→value table |
| 29 | `skyboxes` | Not started | Obfuscated fields — needs a darkan rename pass first |

| 31 | `light_intensities` | Not dumped | |
| 32 | `bas` | Not dumped | |
| 33 | `cursors` | ✅ **Done** | Full editor — hotspot picking on the sprite preview, live "your mouse becomes the cursor" test area with RS-style click crosses, sprite download/upload (uploads allocate a new sprite id), add/remove/clone, save validation |
| 34 | `map_sprites` | Editor | Sprite preview, background colour picker, upscaling toggle, sprite download/upload, add/remove/clone. (Held from Done pending a minimap-render preview — see TODO) |
| 35 | `quests` | Editor | Reads/writes quest JSON and cache structs (start NPC, start location, slot ID, prereq quests, skill requirements) |
| 36 | `areas` | Not started | Map areas (73,896). Dumped from `FileType.MAP_AREAS` (unrelated to the top-level `map_areas` IndexType) |
